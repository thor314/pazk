# What is this?
This is where I'll be collecting resources related to the Study Group on Dr. Justin Thaler's [Proofs
Arguments And Zero Knowledge
Book](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf). The notes
posted here will be copied out of my personal Obsidian note client; certain
features like image and latex embedding will not render on Github, though should
still be readable. If you would like to read them with latex rendering, a
hack solution might be to copy them to a HackMD document. 

The group is open to everyone, and runs out of the [ZK hack discord
server](https://www.zkhack.dev/) by myself and the nice folks at the Zero Knowledge
Podcast.

Have a nice repo of your own? I'd love to link to it!

- A [Zoo](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo) to visit weird and wonderful Complexity classes (note that complexity theory is not required or even core knowledge for this book, but exists as one of many rabbit holes to dive into)

## Protocols to be implemented in the PAZK study group
A list of protocols to be implemented in Rust and Python by me over the course of the Thaler Study club, run out of the ZK hack discord server, published at github.com/thor314/pazk, in the (approximate) period April 2022-December 2022. The list is subject to change.
